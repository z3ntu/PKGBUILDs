   Last Updated November 4, 2016

Summary Of Important Use Restrictions

   Please read all of the Software Terms set forth below

  Scope

   As part of the Services offered by Unity pursuant to the Agreement, Unity
   also provides a downloadable software component (the “Unity Software”),
   which is provided on a non-royalty-bearing basis.  These Additional Terms
   govern your use of the Unity Software (the “Software Terms”). Depending on
   your requirements and circumstances, you will be permitted to use either
   Unity Pro, Unity Plus or Unity Personal.

  Primary Differences Between Unity Pro, Unity Plus and Unity Personal

   All three tiers of the Unity Software share most of the same features and
   functionality.  To see the differences between each tier, please visit
   [1]Unity’s online store.

  Which Version You Can Use - Revenue Restrictions

   Unity Personal may not be used by:

    1. a Commercial Entity that has either: (a) reached annual gross revenues
       in excess of US$100,000, or (b) raised funds (including but not
       limited to crowdfunding) in excess of US$100,000, in each case during
       the most recently completed fiscal year;

    2. a Non-Commercial Entity (this means academic and governmental entities
       as defined below) with a total annual budget in excess of US$100,000
       (for the entire Non-Commercial Entity (not just a department)) for the
       most recently completed fiscal year; or

    3. an individual (not acting on behalf of a Legal Entity) or a Sole
       Proprietor that has reached annual gross revenues in excess of
       US$100,000 from its use of the Unity Software during the most recently
       completed fiscal year, which does not include any income earned by
       that individual which is unrelated to its use of the Unity Software.

   Unity Plus is subject to payment of the applicable subscription fees, but
   may not be used by:

    1. a Commercial Entity that has either: (a) reached annual gross revenues
       in excess of US$200,000, or (b) raised funds (including but not
       limited to crowdfunding) in excess of US$200,000, in each case during
       the most recently completed fiscal year;
    2. a Non-Commercial Entity (this means academic and governmental entities
       as defined below) with a total annual budget in excess of US$200,000
       (for the entire Non-Commercial Entity (not just a department)) for the
       most recently completed fiscal year; or
    3. an individual (not acting on behalf of a Legal Entity) or a Sole
       Proprietor that has reached annual gross revenues in excess of
       US$200,000 from its use of the Unity Software during the most recently
       completed fiscal year, which does not include any income earned by
       that individual which is unrelated to its use of the Unity Software.

   Unity Pro may be used by anyone who pays the applicable subscription fees.

   Unity may monitor your compliance with and enforce these restrictions and
   requirements including but not limited to monitoring the number of
   downloads of Your Project Content and any available revenue estimate data.

  Auto-Renewal

   At the end of the subscription term for Unity Plus or Unity Pro, your
   subscription will automatically renew on a month to month basis at the
   then-current list price, unless you renew the subscription for a new
   subscription term or terminate and cancel it.  You may add new
   subscription seats while on this month-to-month plan without starting a
   new subscription term.  However, if you terminate your month-to-month
   plan, you will have to commit to a new subscription term if you choose to
   start using Unity Plus or Unity Pro again.

    

   You May Not Use Unity Personal, Unity Plus And/Or Unity Pro Simultaneously
    You may not combine or integrate Your Project Content developed with one
   tier of Unity Software (e.g., Unity Personal) simultaneously with any of
   Your Project Content that you develop with another tier (e.g., Unity Plus
   or Unity Pro). Your Project Content developed with Unity Personal and/or
   Unity Plus will be tagged with an identifier that is used to enforce this
   restriction.

  One User Per Seat

   A seat is required for each individual using any version of the Unity
   Software.  You may install the Unity Software on both a primary and a
   secondary computer or operating system for use only by the same user. You
   may not use both installations simultaneously. If you are an educational
   institution and purchase a standard, single educational seat to use the
   Unity Software , you must purchase a seat for each computer on which the
   Unity Software is to be used.

  Unity Console Add-on Developer Requirements

   Use of the Unity Software with certain console platforms is subject to the
   Unity Console Add-on Developer Requirements as set forth on the Unity
   website. The enablement keys for certain Unity Console Add-ons may be
   distributed by the console manufacturer.

  Streaming and Cloud Gaming Restrictions

   You may not directly or indirectly distribute Your Project Content by
   means of streaming or broadcasting where Your Project Content is primarily
   executed on a server and transmitted as a video stream or via low level
   graphics render commands over the open Internet to end user devices
   without a separate license from Unity. This restriction does not prevent
   end users from remotely accessing Your Project Content from an end user
   device that is running on another end user device.

  Embedded Unity Software Restriction

   You may not directly or indirectly distribute Your Project Content
   installed on more than 1,000 electronic devices or systems if Your Project
   Content provides the user interface or primary functionality of such
   electronic device or system without a separate license from Unity. This
   restriction does not prevent you from distributing Your Project Content
   pre-installed on personal computers and consumer electronic devices such
   as mobile phones, tablets, televisions or set top boxes as long as Your
   Project Content does not provide the user interface or primary
   functionality of such device.

  Gambling Restrictions

   You may not distribute or publish any of Your Project Content in
   connection with any Gambling Activities without a separate license from
   Unity.

    

Unity Software Terms

   “Software Terms”), which supplement and incorporate the [2]Unity Terms of
   Service.  By downloading, installing or using the Unity Software in any
   manner, you represent and affirm that you have read, understand and agree

       the Unity Software.

   Unity Pro may be used by anyone who pays the applicable subscription fees.

   During the term of this Agreement, you expressly acknowledge and agree
   that if you are a Unity Personal or Unity Plus user and the above
   thresholds are exceeded, then you may no longer use that tier of the Unity
   Software, and you must either: (a) purchase Unity Plus (if eligible) or
   Unity Pro; or (b) destroy all copies of the Unity Software in your
   possession or control, and cease updating Your Project Content. Unity will

   Unity Personal users may be required to complete a user survey in order to
   activate the Unity Software.

1. Rights to use the Unity Software.

    1. Use Rights. Conditioned upon your compliance with the terms and
       conditions of this Agreement and payment of all applicable
       subscription fees, Unity grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
       royalty-free license: (a) to install and execute the executable form
       of the Unity Software, solely for internal use by a single person to
       develop Your Project Content during the applicable term; and (b) if
       you are using a version of the Unity Software other than an
       educational version, to distribute the runtime portion of the Unity
       Software, on a royalty-free basis, solely as embedded or incorporated
       into Your Project Content and solely to third parties to whom you
       license or sell Your Project Content pursuant to an agreement that is
       no less protective of Unity and its licensors as this Agreement. You
       may not sublicense the rights granted under clause 1.1(a), but you may
       sublicense the rights granted under 1.1(b) solely to third parties to
       whom you license or sell Your Project Content to act as distributors
       thereof pursuant to an agreement no less protective of Unity and its
       licensors as this Agreement.

    2. Copies of Unity Products. You may install the Unity Software on both a
       primary and a secondary computer or operating system, solely for your
       convenience, but only for use by a single person. You may make a
       single copy of the Unity Software solely for backup or archival
       purposes. For the sake of clarity, you may only use one installation
       at any given time. We may in our sole discretion authorize you to
       install the Unity Software on additional computers or operating
       systems upon deactivation of the Unity Software installed on existing
       computers.

    3. Unity Console Add-on Developer Requirements. Use of the Unity Software
       with certain console platforms is subject to the Unity Console Add-on
       Developer Requirements as set forth on the Unity website. The license
       keys to enable certain Unity Console Add-ons may be distributed by the
       console manufacturer.

    4. Third Party Software. The Unity Software incorporates or is bundled
       with Third Party Software governed by separate terms, including open
       source licenses. Such Third Party Software terms are identified in the
       LICENSE.TXT file bundled with the Unity Software and incorporated into
       this Agreement by reference. You agree that you have reviewed and
       accepted those terms and that your use of the Unity Software will be
       deemed acceptance thereof.

2. Restrictions.

    1. Unity Software Tier Restrictions. You acknowledge and agree that as an
       express condition to the rights granted under Section 1, you are not
       permitted to combine or integrate in any manner any of Your Project
       Content developed with one tier of the Unity Software (e.g., Unity
       Personal) with any of Your Project Content developed simultaneously
       with another tier (e.g., Unity Plus or Unity Pro). For the avoidance
       of doubt: (a) if you are a permitted user of Unity Personal, you may
       commence a project using only Unity Personal and subsequently upgrade
       all (but not less than all) of your seats to Unity Plus or Unity Pro,
       and (b) any user of the Unity Software may use content licensed from
       third parties regardless of the tier of Unity Software that was used
       to develop such third party content. You acknowledge and agree that
       Unity may tag Your Project Content created with Unity Personal and/or
       Unity Plus with an identifier to prevent such a prohibited combination
       of Your Project Content.

    2. Educational Product Restrictions. If you are using an educational
       version of the Unity Software, your right to use the Unity Software
       and distribute the runtime portion of the Unity Software in Your
       Project Content is limited to educational, non-commercial purposes.
        Unity may include a watermark designating that Your Project Content
       was created using the education version of the Unity Software.  

    3. Embedded Software Restriction. You may not directly or indirectly
       distribute Your Project Content installed on more than 1,000
       electronic devices or systems if Your Project Content provides the
       user interface or primary functionality of such electronic device or
       system without a separate license from Unity. This restriction does
       not prevent you from distributing Your Project Content pre-installed
       on personal computers and consumer electronic devices such as mobile
       phones, tablets, televisions or set top boxes as long as Your Project
       Content does not provide the user interface or primary functionality
       of such device.

    4. Streaming and Cloud Gaming Restrictions. You may not directly or
       indirectly distribute Your interactive Project Content by means of
       streaming or broadcasting Your Project Content that is primarily
       executed on a server and transmitted over the Internet or other
       network to end user devices without a separate license from Unity.
       This restriction does not prevent end users from remotely accessing
       Your Project Content from an end user device that is running on
       another end user device.

    5. Gambling Restriction. You may not distribute or publish any of Your
       Project Content in connection with any Gambling Activities without a
       separate license agreement from Unity.

    6. General Restrictions. Except as expressly specified in this Agreement,
       you may not: (a) copy (except in the course of loading or installing)
       or modify or create derivative works of the Unity Software; (b)
       distribute, transfer, sublicense, lease, lend, rent or otherwise
       provide access to the Unity Software to any third party; (c) directly
       or indirectly make the functionality of the Unity Software available
       to multiple users or third parties through any means, including but
       not limited to by uploading the Unity Software to a network or
       file-sharing service or through any hosting, application services
       provider, service bureau, software-as-a-service (SaaS) or any other
       technology or service; (d) use the Unity Software for competitive
       analysis or to develop a competing product or service; or (e) do
       anything that could cause or result in the Unity Software (including
       the runtime portion thereof) being subject to any open source license
       (or similar license) that requires as a condition of use, modification
       or distribution that the Unity Software (including the runtime portion
       thereof) or other software combined or distributed with the Unity
       Software be: (i) disclosed or distributed in source code form; (ii)
       licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (iii)
       redistributable at no charge. You acknowledge and agree that portions
       of the Unity Software, including but not limited to the source code
       and the specific design and structure of individual modules or
       programs, are confidential and constitute or contain trade secrets of
       Unity and its licensors. Accordingly, you agree not to disassemble,
       decompile or reverse engineer the Unity Software, in whole or in part,
       or permit or authorize a third party to do so, except to the extent
       such activities are expressly permitted by this Agreement or by law
       notwithstanding this prohibition. Notwithstanding the restriction
       prohibiting decompiling in the immediately preceding sentence, you may
       decompile the Unity Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) assemblies
       solely to inspect their functionality for purposes of understanding or
       improving performance of Your Project Content or any editor extension
       to the Unity Software.

3. Consent to Data Collection; Privacy Policy Obligations.

    1. You acknowledge and accept [3]Unity's privacy policy. You agree that
       the Unity Software (including the Unity runtime in Your Project
       Content) may send data to Unity to: (a) check for Unity Software
       updates; (b) provide aggregated usage statistics of your use of the
       Unity Software and the use of Your Project Content by end users; (c)
       provide optional Developer Services; and (d) validate seats in order
       to prevent unauthorized use. You acknowledge and agree that Unity may
       deliver messages and contact you about the Unity Software and other
       Unity product and service offerings.

    2. You agree to distribute Your Project Content with a privacy policy
       explaining the data you collect through Your Project Content and how
       you collect, use, share, and protect it; and to include a disclosure
       that Unity is your service provider and collects certain data from
       Your Project Content, along with a link to [4]Unity's privacy policy,
       which may be updated from time to time.

4. Support.

   You may access the online forums and the Unity Answers knowledge base
   through the Site. You may also email support@unity3d.com for assistance
   with your seats. Technical support may be offered by Unity at its sole
   discretion as described on the Unity website. You acknowledge and agree
   that Unity has no obligation under this Agreement to provide patches,
   updates, new releases or new versions of the Unity Software.

5. Term.

   Subscription based seats for Unity Pro and Unity Plus will remain in
   effect for the initial subscription period (which has a minimum commitment
   of 12 months), and thereafter such seat will automatically renew on a
   month-to-month basis at the then-current list price, unless you renew the
   subscription for a new subscription term or terminate and cancel it as
   described on the Site. For clarity, subscription based seats for Unity Pro
   and Unity Plus are not cancelable during the applicable subscription term
   and are non-refundable. Upon termination, you must at Unity’s option
   either promptly delete and destroy or return to Unity all copies of the
   Unity Software in your possession or control; however, if you have
   subscribed to use a seat of the Unity Software for the prior twenty-four
   (24) consecutive months, you may continue to use the then-current version
   of the Unity Software for that seat after the subscription term.

   Paid in full, perpetual seats will remain in effect unless earlier
   terminated in accordance with the Agreement.
